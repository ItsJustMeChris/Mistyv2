# Misty
> Misty is a rotation addon for World of Warcraft which utilizes the power of an advanced lua unlocker to automate the gameplay of the player.  

## This is a personal project
> It's not meant to be anything more, if you use it and make your own rotations then great for you but I do not expect you to use or create anything in this addon, it's purely for my own educational objective.  

### Credits/Thanks
> Demilz (Patrik) for dynamic lua loader.  G1zStar for being <3
